# Expenditure-Manager

The project “Expenditure Manager” is based on Amazon Alexa. The main motive of
developing this project is to make life of differently abled, specially blind people, easier. We
intend to help them in managing their daily expenses with Amazon Alexa. The product will
work on voice commands therefore anyone can easily use it. Users can use this Alexa skill
using any Alexa-enabled devices (like Alexa mobile app, Alexa echo devices, etc.) to manage
& analyze their expenses. Along with personal expenses, users can also manage the group
expenses and split the expenses among themselves. Also, they can easily analyze their
expenditures like how and when they are spending their money. Expenses can be
categorized as Fuel, Entertainment, Study, Accommodation, Rentals, Personal, Food, Travel,
Accessories etc. Users can add, edit, analyze & split their expenses using simple voice
commands.
